# Are you confused between Collection, Collection Interface, Collections Class, Collection Framework?

## Collection:
A group of individual objects that represent a single entity is known as a collection. It is the common word that you used in your daily life.


## Collection Framework: 
To represent a group of objects as a single entity in the Java programming language we need classes and interfaces defined by the Collection Framework.

N.B: If are from C++ background that you can compare "Collection" with "Containers" and "Collection Framework" with "STL(Standard Template Library)".


## Collection Interface: 
- Interfaces specify what a class must do and not how. It is the blueprint of the class.
-  It is the root interface of the Collection Framework that defines the most common methods that can be used for any collection objects. Or you can say it represents the individual object as a single entity.

## Collections Class:
- It is present in java.util package and is a member of Collection Framework.
- This class provides many utility methods for the collection object

## Collection vs Collections in Java with Example

Collection: 
- Collection is a interface present in java.util package.
- It is used to represent a group of individual objects as a single unit. 
- It is similar to the container in the C++ language. 
- The collection is considered as the root interface of the collection framework.
- It provides several classes and interfaces to represent a group of individual objects as a single unit. 
- The List, Set, and Queue are the main sub-interfaces of the collection interface. 
- The map interface is also part of the java collection framework, but it doesnâ€™t inherit the collection of the interface.

Collections: 
- Collections is a utility class present in java.util package.
- It defines several utility methods like sorting and searching which is used to operate on collection.
- It has all static methods. These methods provide much-needed convenience to developers, allowing them to effectively work with Collection Framework.
- For example, It has a method sort() to sort the collection elements according to default sorting order, and it has a method min(), and max() to find the minimum and maximum value respectively in the collection elements.
