# Are you confused between Collection, Collection Interface, Collections Class, Collection Framework?

## Collection:
A group of individual objects that represent a single entity is known as a collection. It is the common word that you used in your daily life.

## Collection Framework: 
To represent a group of objects as a single entity in the Java programming language we need classes and interfaces defined by the Collection Framework.

-  N.B: If are from C++ background that you can compare "Collection" with "Containers" and "Collection Framework" with "STL(Standard Template Library)".


## Collection Interface: 
Interfaces specify what a class must do and not how. It is the blueprint of the class. It is the root interface of the Collection Framework that defines the most common methods that can be used for any collection objects. Or you can say it represents the individual object as a single entity.

## Collections Class:
It is present in java.util package and is a member of Collection Framework. This class provides many utility methods for the collection object
