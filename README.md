# Java-Collections
- Any group of objects that are represented as a single unit is known as a Java Collection of Objects.

- In Java, a separate framework named the “Collection Framework” has been defined in JDK 1.2 
  which holds all the Java Collection Classes and Interface in it.

- In Java, the Collection interface (java.util.Collection) and Map interface (java.util.Map) are the two main “root” interfaces of Java collection classes.
