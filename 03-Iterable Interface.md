# Iterable interface

- is the root interface for the entire collection framework. 
- The collection interface extends the iterable interface. 
- Therefore, inherently, all the interfaces and classes implement this interface.
- The main functionality of this interface is to provide an iterator for the collections. 
- which provides the iterator to iterate through all the collections.
