# Map Interface
## The map interface is also part of the java collection framework, but it doesn’t inherit the collection of the interface.

- A map is a data structure that supports the key-value pair for mapping the data.
- This interface doesn’t support duplicate keys because the same key cannot have multiple mappings, however, it allows duplicate values in different keys.
- A map is useful if there is data and we wish to perform operations on the basis of the key.
- This map interface is implemented by various classes like HashMap, TreeMap, etc.
- Since all the subclasses implement the map, we can instantiate a map object with any of these classes.
